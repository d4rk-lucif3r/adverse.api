# Security Measures

## Sensitive Data Handling

- All backup data files containing potential sensitive information should be excluded from version control
- MongoDB ObjectIds should not be confused with API keys, but proper data sanitization should still be implemented
- The `/backup_data/` directory has been added to .gitignore to prevent accidental commit of sensitive data

## Best Practices

- Always validate and sanitize data before storage or transmission
- Use environment variables for storing actual API keys and secrets
- Regularly audit code and data for potential security issues
- Implement proper access controls for sensitive data
